War Simulation:
The World of War Simulation will try to mirror some key aspects of wars. There will be two opposing parties who will fight a war against each other. The one party will be controlled by the simulation user (who plays the role of a War strategist) and the other  party controlled by "Evil General" (the computer) who randomly makes decisions. The first task is to select an army configuration from 5 possible army configurations. Each combination offers a different mix of 6 battalions where each battalion can either be a Tank, Infantry, Medic, or Supply Battalion. Tank and Infantry Battalions have both damage (DP) and health (HP) points associated with them. Medic Battalions have rejuvenation power (RP) and a Supply Battalion increases an army's HP and grants the army an extra move in a battle.
Once the opponents have selected their army configurations, they will take turns attacking or defending their opponent's attacks. When an opponent attacks another opponent, the total damage points (DP) from all the attacker's available tanks and infantry units will issue damage against the opposing players' total health points (HP).
When an opponent defends the opposing party, the medics' total rejuvenation power (RP) will be added to the opponent's total HP to restore it after the damage has occurred. Medics cannot rejuvenate a dead tank or infantry unit. Once a tank or soldier is dead, their HP is completely lost. Nor can a  medic heal a fully healed army.
Each War will consist of three battles in which each party can attack or defend five times. This mimics the different phases of a battle. An additional move is granted to a party for every supply unit in their army's configuration. The opponent with the highest HP at the end of the battle wins the battle. 
During the phase of the players choosing to defend or attack, no limitation is put on the strategy allowed, i.e. if a player wishes to try to attack with no attack units, The simulation will not restrict this. In the words of Napoleon Bonaparte, "Never interrupt your opponent when he is making a mistake."
